In March 2019 a I was interested in answering the following question: Can the number of hard to open pistachios per package be significantly reduced? Currently there are about 5 - 10% of closed or almost closed pistachios that end up getting shipped to customers. Can these be filtered out?

My results using Deep Learning were pretty impressive: We quickly achieved 100% classification accuracy to the great satisfaction of our customer.
